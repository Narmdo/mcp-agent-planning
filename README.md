# AI Reasoning Framework

## Project Overview

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides persistent, structured state management for agentic AI workflows. This framework solves the fundamental problem of context loss and decision degradation when AI agents work across multiple chat sessions or context windows.

## Problem Statement

Current agentic AI workflows suffer from several critical issues:

1. **Context Degradation**: Limited context windows cause agents to lose understanding over time
2. **Session Discontinuity**: Opening new chat windows results in complete loss of project state and progress
3. **Decision Regression**: Agents flip-flop on decisions or undo previous work due to lack of persistent decision history
4. **Unreliable State Management**: Free-form documentation approaches (asking agents to "create docs as needed") result in inconsistent, outdated, or unmaintained state

## Solution Approach

This framework provides structured, tool-enforced state management through an MCP server that:

- **Enforces Consistency**: JSON schemas and validation prevent inconsistent state updates
- **Enables Seamless Handoffs**: New agents can instantly understand current project status and continue work
- **Preserves Decisions**: User corrections and architectural choices are permanently logged to prevent regression
- **Structures Knowledge**: Codebase understanding and task progress are maintained in queryable formats

## Core Goals

### Primary Objectives
- Enable agents to persistently maintain project context across sessions
- Provide structured tools that enforce consistent state management
- Allow seamless handoffs between different AI agents/sessions
- Prevent decision regression through structured decision logging

### Secondary Objectives
- Support multiple simultaneous projects (branch-scoped or project-scoped contexts)
- Provide queryable project history and decision rationale
- Enable rollback/recovery of project states
- Support various development workflows (refactoring, feature development, bug fixes)

## Architecture Overview

### MCP Server Tools (Planned)
- `get_current_context()` - Load existing project state or indicate initialization needed
- `initialize_context()` - Set up new project with structured schema
- `query_context()` - Query specific aspects of project state (tasks, decisions, files, etc.)
- `update_task_status()` - Modify task progress with structured updates
- `record_decision()` - Log architectural decisions and user preferences
- `map_relevant_code()` - Maintain understanding of relevant codebase components

### Data Storage
- **Backend**: SQLite for structured, queryable storage with schema enforcement
- **Schema**: JSON-defined schemas for all state types
- **Scoping**: Branch-based or project-based context isolation

### Integration
- Compatible with any MCP-supporting chat interface (Claude, etc.)
- IDE-agnostic approach
- No modification required to existing chat interfaces

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core MCP Server
- Basic state initialization and loading
- Core schema definitions
- Essential tools: get_current_context, initialize_context, query_context

### Phase 2: Enhanced State Management
- Task progression tracking
- Decision logging and retrieval
- Codebase mapping capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Multi-project support
- State history and rollback
- Advanced querying and reporting

### Phase 4: Optimization & Polish
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced schemas based on usage patterns
- Documentation and examples

## Success Criteria

1. **Agent Continuity**: An agent should be able to resume work on any project within 1-2 tool calls, regardless of time elapsed
2. **Decision Persistence**: User corrections and architectural choices should never be lost or contradicted by future agents
3. **State Reliability**: Project state should always reflect actual progress accurately
4. **Workflow Integration**: The framework should integrate seamlessly into existing development workflows without requiring new chat interfaces or IDE changes

## Meta-Development Approach

Once the core MCP server is functional, this project will be developed using its own framework - demonstrating the self-improving nature of structured agentic workflows.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Planning and Architecture Design  
**Next Steps**: Begin MCP server implementation with core context management tools  
**Branch**: main
